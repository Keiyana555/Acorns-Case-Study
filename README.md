# Acorns-Case-Study
# Unit 1 HW

## Acorns is an investing app lets people automatically invest their spare change by rounding up the purchases they make with a linked credit or debit card.

 Acorns 
Incorporated on February 29, 2012 headquartered in Irvine, CA.  founded by  Jeff Cruttenden and  Walter Cruttenden 

It all started while Jeff Cruttenden was attending college at Lewis and Clark in Oregon. He realized that so many of his peers were interested in investing but faced a similar set of barriers that kept them from being successful. One in particular being the high minimum balance requirements and fees that go along with being a successful investor in the market. This led Jeff and his father Walter Cruttenden to sought out how  to simplify investing and create a more realistic approach for young people to get started.

Acorns has raised a total of $207M in funding over 10 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Dec 1, 2019 from a Venture - Series Unknown round.
Acorns is funded by 29 investors.(Chris Adamo,BDMI,Jennifer Lopez,Alex Rodriguez,Bain Capital Ventures,Comcast Ventures,NBCUniversal..et al)


Acorns looks to take spare change using a roundup method to help people who struggle with saving to save money in an account that allows them to have money in the future to make investments that later bring in capital and allow them to earn and grow their financial portfolio through wealth management. It gives people with lower levels of capital the ability to save in order to make better investments that drive their money up and give access to more options. 

 Acorns targets millenials as well as people who make 100k a year. Best for people who want to be hands off investors. More than 1.6 million people now have an account with Acorns, with 75% of them between the ages of 18 and 34. Free to download, fees are just $1 a month for accounts under $5,000, and 0.25% per year for accounts with more.Acorns is not in the asset accumulation business.Some
  companies have a mission statement and some have a corporate vision while others have both. Since launching in 2012, they have grown to over 3.5 million accounts. They offer the ability to gain knowledge and invest in a slow-growth over time method that still allows a person to see and keep track of how these short investemnts can lead to a bigger broader range of long-term wealth. The age range falls from 18 to 88 years. But the  average user is about 29 years old. When you think of the avatar for their  user base, it’s someone who’s 29, probably college-educated, carrying a fair amount of student debt and making somewhere around $50,000 or $55,000 in household income. That is fairly representative of America. Also, the clients tend to congregate around urban areas.

Acorns uses 53 technology products and services including HTML5, Google Analytics, and jQuery, according to G2 Stack.Acorns is actively using 82 technologies for its website, according to BuiltWith. These include Viewport Meta, IPhone / Mobile Compatible, and SPF.

It belongs to the Financial services and Wealth management domain of the financial industry. Included in the FinTech App market that makes it a major part of Financial Technology. 

New firms and new business models as well as renewed commitment by incumbent WM firms will drive higher intensity of competition for the same clients and the same assets.

As an advisor for the company one service I would advise the usage of Human financial advisor through video servicing along with the Robo-advisor service as a referral. Though the usage of computer algorithims is cost effective and proves right in pairing for the investor it doesn't provide the comfortability of having a person who they can have complete access to on their own time based on compatibility and interests in certain parts of investing. This would allow the consumer to be even more comfortable using the interface because of the connection they can have with their advisor if they so choose. 
The technologies involved would be that of the video-conferencing app that would allow the advisor to communicate digitally with the consumer. 
 This offering up a safe space for a person to go over their financials with a person with experience. A robo advisor is great at portfolio management but an actual human advisor helps diagnose personal financial issues that algorithims have no access to beginnig to guess. This would allow for the consumer to have access to financial planning on the negative and positive end inn order to develop a more well rounded wealth portfolio for generations to come starting at the millenial level.
